# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Psychology and Linguistics. I love learning about people and language, so these majors really spoke to me. I'm in my fourth and final year of undergraduate study.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I really enjoyed my Stage one stats paper and think that taking more statistics will be useful for postgraduate study.
- I am interested in learning about how to efficiently and accurately use code to visualise data.
