# Stats 220

## A little bit about me 
* I am undertaking a conjoint degree in Psychology and Linguistics. I *love* learning about people and language, so these majors really spoke to me. I'm in my fourth and final year of undergraduate study (finally!)
  - If you've never heard of linguistics, I really recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yLXNzDUH58) to get an overview of the subject!
* I have twin brothers and two absolutely crazy dogs called Maisie and Rafa
* I'm currently learning my fourth language (excluding English)! In the past, I've learned French, Latin, and Greek, and currently I'm learning Portuguese so that I can better communicate with my partner's family ☺️
* In my spare time, you can catch me reading or, more likely, playing the Sims

## What's a psychology major doing here?!
So, there are a few reasons why I'm taking this paper: 
1. First and foremost, I really enjoyed stats in my first year and have been thinking about revisiting it for a while.
2. This paper sounded really fun and interesting!
3. I think some coding experience will be really good for me in my postgraduate years. I really want to go on to study [Postgraduate Psychology](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/psychology/postgraduate.html), specifically [this programme](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/master-of-behaviour-analysis.html), and coding plays a big role in postgraduate psychology!
